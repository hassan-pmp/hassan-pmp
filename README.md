## Hi there 

## Hello there! 👋
- I'm Hassan, a passionate **Project Manager**, **Scrum Master**, **Agile Coach** with a mind full of ideas 💻.
- When I'm not busy building innovative solutions, you can find me geeking out over GenAI, Writing Scientific Article , Reading Books, and YouTube.
- Work hard, help harder 💪. I'm driven by a desire to create technology that makes a real difference in people's lives. The more I work, the more I want to help others - it's a virtuous cycle of awesomeness 🔄!

- On this GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of my daily learning tips, projects, experiments, and collaborations. Take a look around, and let's build something amazing together! 🚀
- Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about a project, or just want to say hi 👋.
